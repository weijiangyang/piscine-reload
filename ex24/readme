1. ` NAME = libft.a:
NAME is a variable that defines the name of the output file.

In this case, it is set to libft.a, which will be the static library created after compiling the object files (.o files).

2. FLAG = -Wall -Wextra -Werror:
FLAG is a variable that stores compiler flags to be used when compiling the source files.

-Wall: Enables most of the warnings.

-Wextra: Enables extra warnings that are not part of the default warnings.

-Werror: Treats all warnings as errors (compilation will fail if there are any warnings).

3. PATH_SRC = ./srcs/:
PATH_SRC is a variable that defines the path to the source files.

Here, it's set to the srcs/ folder. This means all the source files (.c files) are located in the ./srcs/ directory.

4. SRC = $(PATH_SRC)ft_putchar.c $(PATH_SRC)ft_swap.c $(PATH_SRC)ft_putstr.c $(PATH_SRC)ft_strlen.c $(PATH_SRC)ft_strcmp.c:
SRC is a variable that contains a list of all the source files that will be compiled to create the object files (.o files).

The $(PATH_SRC) is prepended to each file name to define the full path to the source files. The source files are:

ft_putchar.c

ft_swap.c

ft_putstr.c

ft_strlen.c

ft_strcmp.c

5. OBJ = $(SRC:.c=.o):
OBJ is a variable that defines a list of object files (.o files).

This line uses a pattern substitution to convert all .c file extensions in the SRC variable to .o extensions.

For example, $(PATH_SRC)ft_putchar.c becomes $(PATH_SRC)ft_putchar.o, and so on for the other source files.

6. PATH_HEADER = ./includes/:
PATH_HEADER is a variable that defines the path to the header files.

The header files are located in the includes/ directory.

7. all: $(NAME):
The default target of the Makefile is all. This will be the first target to run when you simply type make in the terminal.

The all target depends on $(NAME), which is the libft.a file. This means that make will attempt to build libft.a when make is called.

8. $(NAME): $(OBJ):
This rule specifies that to build $(NAME) (which is libft.a), the object files ($(OBJ)) are required.

The command for this target is:

bash
Copy
Edit
ar rc $(NAME) $^
ar: The ar command is used to create an archive (in this case, a static library).

rc: These are flags for ar:

r: Replace or add files to the archive.

c: Create the archive if it doesnâ€™t already exist.

$(NAME): This is the output file (i.e., libft.a).

$^: This is an automatic variable that represents all the prerequisites (the object files, $(OBJ)).

9. $(PATH_SRC)%.o: $(PATH_SRC)%.c:
This rule defines how to compile the source files (.c files) into object files (.o files).

$(PATH_SRC)%.o matches object files (e.g., ./srcs/ft_putchar.o).

$(PATH_SRC)%.c matches source files (e.g., ./srcs/ft_putchar.c).

The rule says that to build an object file (%.o) from a source file (%.c), use the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
cc $(FLAG) -I$(PATH_HEADER) -c $< -o $@
cc: This is the C compiler.

$(FLAG): These are the compiler flags (-Wall -Wextra -Werror).

-I$(PATH_HEADER): This tells the compiler to look for header files in the $(PATH_HEADER) directory (i.e., ./includes/).

-c $<: This tells the compiler to compile the source file ($<) into an object file. $< is the automatic variable that represents the first prerequisite (in this case, the .c file).

-o $@: This specifies the output file ($@), which is the object file (.o).

10. clean::
The clean target is used to remove object files (.o files).

The command is:

bash
Copy
Edit
rm -f $(OBJ)
This removes all the object files ($(OBJ)), which are the compiled .o files.

The -f flag forces removal without asking for confirmation.

11. fclean: clean:
The fclean target first runs the clean target (to remove the object files) and then also removes the static library (libft.a).

The command is:

bash
Copy
Edit
rm -f $(NAME)
This removes the static library (libft.a).

12. re: fclean all:
The re target is a common target for "rebuilding" the entire project.

It first runs fclean (to remove all object files and the library) and then runs all (to rebuild the library).

This ensures that the library and object files are completely rebuilt from scratch.

Summary:
This Makefile defines the build process for creating a static library (libft.a). Here's what it does:

Compiles the source files (.c) into object files (.o).

Archives the object files into a static library (libft.a) using the ar command.

Provides targets for cleaning up (removing object files and the static library) and rebuilding everything from scratch.

To use it:

make will build the static library (libft.a).

make clean will remove object files.

make fclean will remove both object files and the static library.

make re will clean and then rebuild everything.
