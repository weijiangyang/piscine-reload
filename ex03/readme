Explanation:
find .:

find is a command used to search for files or directories.

. refers to the current directory. This means that find will search in the current directory and all its subdirectories.

-type f:

This tells find to only look for files (ignoring directories, symlinks, etc.).

-f stands for "file", so only regular files are selected.

-name '*.sh':

This is a name pattern.

*.sh means any file whose name ends with .sh, which is typically used for shell script files.

The * is a wildcard that matches any string of characters, so it will match files like script.sh, test.sh, hello_world.sh, etc.

-exec:

This allows find to execute a command on each file that matches the search criteria.

In this case, -exec will execute the basename command on each file that matches the pattern.

basename {} .sh:

basename is a command that strips the directory path and optionally a suffix from the filename.

{} is a placeholder for the current file found by find. It will be replaced by each file name one by one.

.sh is the suffix that basename will remove from the file name.

For example, if the file is script.sh, basename will strip off the .sh suffix and return script.

So, for each file that ends in .sh, basename will remove .sh and return just the base name of the file.

\;:

The semicolon ; is used to end the -exec command.

The backslash \ is used to escape the semicolon, because semicolons are special characters in the shell. Escaping it tells the shell to treat it as part of the command and not as a command separator.

What happens when you run this command?
It searches the current directory and subdirectories for files that match the pattern *.sh (i.e., files ending with .sh).

For each file that matches, the basename command is executed to strip the .sh suffix from the file name.

It prints the base name of each file without the .sh extension.

Example:
If your directory structure looks like this:

bash
Copy
Edit
./script.sh
./test.sh
./hello_world.sh
./subdir/another_script.sh
Running the command:

bash
Copy
Edit
find . -type f -name '*.sh' -exec basename {} .sh \;
Would produce the following output:

bash
Copy
Edit
script
test
hello_world
another_script
Each file's name has been stripped of the .sh extension.
