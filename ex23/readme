1. #ifndef FT_POINT_H:
#ifndef is a preprocessor conditional directive in C.

It stands for "if not defined".

This checks whether the macro FT_POINT_H has been defined earlier in the code or in any header files included in the project.

If FT_POINT_H is not defined, the code that follows this line (up to the matching #endif) will be included by the preprocessor.

If FT_POINT_H is already defined, the code between #ifndef and #endif will be skipped.

2. #define FT_POINT_H:
#define is another preprocessor directive that defines a macro.

In this case, #define FT_POINT_H defines the macro FT_POINT_H.

This means, after this point in the code, any subsequent #ifndef FT_POINT_H checks will find that FT_POINT_H is defined, and the code between #ifndef and #endif will be skipped.

Essentially, this is a way to ensure that the code between #ifndef and #endif is included only once in the compilation process, preventing multiple definitions of the same thing.

3. The typedef struct s_point:
typedef is used to create a new type alias.

struct s_point is a structure definition. A structure is a user-defined data type in C that allows you to group different types of variables under a single name.

s_point is the name of the structure, and t_point will be the new type alias for this structure (created by the typedef).

Structure breakdown:

c
Copy
Edit
typedef struct s_point
{
        int     x;
        int     y;
}               t_point;
s_point defines a structure with two members:

x: an integer representing the x-coordinate.

y: an integer representing the y-coordinate.

t_point is a type alias for the structure struct s_point. This means that, after this line, you can declare variables of type t_point to represent points in 2D space, like so:

c
Copy
Edit
t_point point1;
point1.x = 10;
point1.y = 20;
4. #endif:
This marks the end of the conditional directive #ifndef.

If FT_POINT_H was not defined previously, the code between #ifndef and #endif gets included; otherwise, it gets skipped.

Why use #ifndef and #define together?
This combination is used to prevent multiple inclusions of the same header file, which is known as an include guard.

When you include a header file multiple times in your code (either directly or indirectly), it could cause errors like multiple definitions of structures, functions, or variables.

The #ifndef and #define combo ensures that the code inside the file is only included once, no matter how many times the header is included.

Example Usage:
Let's imagine you have the following structure:

header file: ft_point.h (this file contains your code above):

c
Copy
Edit
#ifndef FT_POINT_H
# define FT_POINT_H

typedef struct s_point
{
        int     x;
        int     y;
}               t_point;

#endif
Now, in your main program file (e.g., main.c), you can include this header file and use the t_point type:

main.c:

c
Copy
Edit
#include "ft_point.h"

int main() {
    t_point p1;
    p1.x = 5;
    p1.y = 10;
    
    return 0;
}
If you accidentally include ft_point.h multiple times, the #ifndef FT_POINT_H check will ensure that the structure is only defined once, preventing errors.

For example:

c
Copy
Edit
#include "ft_point.h"
#include "ft_point.h"  // This second inclusion is safe due to the include guard.
In summary:
#ifndef FT_POINT_H checks if FT_POINT_H is defined. If it's not, the code inside the #ifndef/#endif block will be included.

#define FT_POINT_H defines the macro FT_POINT_H, ensuring that the code is not included again in the future.

The structure t_point is defined as a 2D point with x and y coordinates.

This pattern prevents multiple definitions of the structure or other code, ensuring safe inclusion of the header file across multiple source files.

This is a common technique in C to manage header files and avoid potential issues with multiple inclusions.
